### Overview

**EdgeOverflowForecast** is an end-to-end framework for **integer-only quantized deep learning models** (LSTM and Transformer) targeting **low-power embedded FPGAs**.  
It is designed for **short-term filling level forecasting in combined sewer systems** to support energy-efficient and resilient smart city infrastructure.

This repository provides:
- 🔧 Support **training and quantization-aware training (QAT)** of LSTM and Transformer models  
- 🧱 Automated **RTL code generation and FPGA synthesis** for deployment  
- ⚙️ Integrated **hardware-aware hyperparameter optimization** using Optuna  

> ⚠️ This repository works in tandem with our [ElasticAI.Creator](https://github.com/es-ude/elastic-ai.creator) library, which provides the core VHDL templates and quantization modules for hardware generation. Please make sure to install it as part of the setup process.

## Dataset
For carrying out the experiments and training our models we disposed of a real-world dataset of a Combined Sewer System in the city of Duisburg, Germany, provided by the Wirtschaftsbetriebe Duisburg (WBD). The full dataset cannot be made publicly available, because of information on critical infrastructure. For further details on the dataset, please refer to the paper or contact us.

## Usage
All runnable scripts are organized in the **`scripts/`** folder for convenience:
```
scripts/
├── hardware/                     # Hardware synthesis, power & resource estimation
│   ├── hw_analysis_pipeline.sh   # Main pipeline for FPGA synthesis + analysis
│   ├── power_estimation.tcl      # Vivado power estimation script
│   ├── resource_estimation.tcl   # Vivado resource estimation script
│   └── selected_timestamp.txt    # Selected files for execute hardware synthesis
│
├── optuna/            # Hardware-aware optimizationo search
│   ├── amd/           # Configs for AMD FPGA platforms
│   ├── fp32_train.sh  # Run FP32 model search
│   └── quant_train.sh # Run quantized model search
│
└── software/      # Pure software training and evaluation
├── fp32/          # FP32 model training/evaluation scripts
└── quant/         # Quantized model QAT/evaluation scripts
```
You can **run scripts directly** from their folders.  
For example:
```bash
# Train FP32 model
bash scripts/software/fp32_train.sh

# Model QAT
bash scripts/software/quant_train.sh

# Run full FPGA synthesis and analysis after model QAT
bash scripts/hardware/hw_analysis_pipeline.sh

# Train FP32 model with Optuna search
bash scripts/optuna/fp32_train.sh

# Model QAT with bi-objective Optuna search
bash scripts/optuna/quant_train.sh
```
